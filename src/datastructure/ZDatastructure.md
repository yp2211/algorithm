## 1. What is Java?
Before we learn about Data Structures using Java, let us understand what Java means.

* Java is a
  - a programming language
  - object-oriented
  - high level
  - originally developed by Sun Microsystems
* It follows the WORA principle
  - stands for “Write Once Run Anywhere”
  - you can run a java program as many times as you want on a java supported platform after it is compiled.

## 2. What are Data Structures?
* Made up of 2 words
  - “DATA” + “STRUCTURES”
* It is a way to arrange data on computers
* Example: You might want to store data in
  - Linear fashion – Array/ Linked List
  - One on the other – Stacks
  - Hierarchical Fashion – Trees
  - Connect Nodes – Graph
